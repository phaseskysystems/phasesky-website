# PhaseSky

PhaseSky is an engineering-focused project developing a custom micro-drone platform from the ground up.

This repository documents the design and development of open-source flight control software alongside custom flight hardware. The work emphasizes systems-level thinking—where electronics, control logic, signal timing, and physical constraints are designed together rather than assembled from off-the-shelf components.

## Project Focus

- Open-source flight control architecture
- Custom PCB design for flight systems
- Integrated hardware–software development
- Transparent documentation of design decisions
- Iterative testing and refinement

## Philosophy

PhaseSky treats drones as complete systems, not products.  
Each stage is built, tested, and refined before advancing.

The long-term direction is synchronized, mesh-capable aerial systems.  
The near-term focus is correctness: stable flight, reliable electronics, and disciplined engineering.

## Current Status

Active development  
Early hardware and control architecture in progress

## Licensing

Core flight control software is released under an open-source license.  
Hardware designs may be released separately as they mature.
